BeeAre：抱歉最近潜水得有点久，不过我带来了病情上的好消息。  
我想这意味着该是大讲故事的时候了！  
我得的是WPW综合征。为此我在二月初就去了医院，之后一直在静养。  
我在那里的时候，他们快把我折腾得筋疲力尽了。  
我从医生那里了解到的情况是，他们在我大腿上插了根导管到我的心脏，以此来寻找那根过于活跃的神经。  
当医生确定他们找到了那根神经之后，他们趁热打铁很快就干掉了它。把那根该死的神经烧掉，就像某人朝2015年最新的Rap专辑上吐口水一样。  
我不得不彻夜不眠。时间过得很快，转眼间就到第二天早上了，然后我们回了家。除了插导管的地方附近有点瘀伤，并且腿有点酸以外，我没什么大碍（他们用了我大腿里的血管）。  
（手术）很成功，希望以后身体不会再出毛病，心脏也能恢复正常。  
这就是我如何烧了我的心脏然后还活了过来跟你们讲述这一切的故事——也感谢你们能耐心等待这么久！  
希望这意味着我们PpGD的更新可以恢复正常！:D

BeeAre: I am sorry for my absence, but I have good news on the medical front.  
I believe that means it is STORY TIME!  
I had something called Wolfe-Parkinson-White Syndrome. I went to the hospital at the beginning of February for this procedure, and have been recovering.  
Now, while I was there, they had to knock me out.  
From what I understand from the doctor, they went into my heart with a catheter in my thigh to search for an overactive nerve.  
Once the doctor was certain they'd found the nerve, they dropped it like it was hot. Burned that jerk-ass nerve like someone spitting the freshest rap album of 2015.  
I had to stay overnight. It passed quickly, and suddenly it was next morning, and then we went home. I had nothing but some bruising around the catheter insertion sites and sore legs (they used my femoral veins in my thighs).  
Great success, hopefully there will be no more issues and my heart will return to normal.  
And that's the story of how I got my heart burned and lived to tell the tale--and congratulations to you for surviving reading this far!  
Hopefully this means we can resume normal updates of PpGD! :D
