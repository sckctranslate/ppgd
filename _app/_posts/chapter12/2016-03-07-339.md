BeeAre：好像我弄得某些人误以为贝尔回到了另一个以前的时光。既然那束穿越云层的紫光还不够明显的话，我就直说“并不是这样”吧。时间顺序上，这一切其实很简单：现在仍然是在战后。他们是在另一个“空间”里，而非另一个“时间”里。炸弹是覆盖了整个地球的。想起来了吗？整个地球都被包起来了。月亮也没能幸免。这是肯定的……但如果你非要跟我扯“量子力学”——相信我，我很清楚——时间和空间其实是描述同一个事物的两种不同的方式。这些都是测量的梯度，或者叫做“量度”。我倒是很想知道，在炸弹爆炸的时候，如果你刚好从火星看过来，你会觉得地球发生了什么呢……？:0) 吼吼

BeeAre: I’ve had a few people wondering if Bell is in another classical time period. In case the purple streaks through the clouds weren’t obvious, I’ll be candid and say no. Chronologically, let’s be simple: this is still after the battle. They’re in a different “where”, not a different “when”. The bomb, it coated Earth. Remember? Everywhere on Earth. The moon, too. Of course… if you want to get strictly “quantum mechanics” about it–and believe me, I do–remember that time and space are actually different ways to describe the same thing. They are gradients of measurement which we call “dimension”. I wonder, then, what you might think was happening to Earth when the bomb went off… if you were coincidentally watching from Mars…? :0) honk honk
