BeeAre: Blossom can't take it. If she had just accepted the new information... If she had just not been so afraid... Who knows what might have happened. Well, I do. But that's neither here nor there. 8D

Bleedman: Sorry for delayed update. My phone and internet went down on Holy Week, ya know a time when everyone is required to have mandatory holidays so they could go watch some nut get crucified. 

Yeah they wanna be like Jesus, I think they could do more by helping the needy and feed the poor or something but nope... get pinned to the cross for the whole world to see. Good thing they have medics ready.

Honestly for me this isn't holy week anymore, it's a Carnival freak show. wtf.
