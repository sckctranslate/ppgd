BeeAre: Thank Goodness! Bleedman, as you all know, lives in the Philippines, and they just had a huge typhoon over there! D: I am glad he is okay! That means more comic pages! :D Speaking of: Samantha is getting scary, now! Oh, no! It was hard to title this page without jinxing myself for the potential use of later cool title phrases, but I think this one adequately explains how the tables just got turned in a hurry! So hurry they were flipped! (╯`□´)╯︵ ┻━┻
