BeeAre: Too many alternate titles to count. So many ideas with masks and real people and robots and how hate and anger are too often simulated to further someone else's idea. One thing I noticed and liked, however: we see each of the current three players on Team Bad Guy as examples of various forms of the page title. So I thought I would bring attention to that idea. It's kinda neat. ...I mean, I like it. Don't want to go off the deep end into MSG4 "War Has Changed" stuff with you guys. Unless you independently want to. Go nuts!
