BeeAre: We're in the overdrive, slam-bams and whammies are rolling. ...I hope I don't sound too much like the announcer to a skateboard game, listing the combos. ...But it would be pretty cool to have a superhero game that awarded victory through style points. Some weird combo of extreme sports, action superhero, rhythm game. Rights to all the NBA intermission music would be essential. How else would I know when to slam, or if I was welcome to the jam?!
