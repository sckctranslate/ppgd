Здравствуйте. こんにちは。 :0) 吼吼<br />\n我仍然会时不时发病，但我还是想在这里提一些事情，毕竟我的药物起效了，人也比较清醒。<br />\n看到不少人在讨论恋爱情节。让我在这里讲清楚：<br />\n我不会让花花去配比比。也不会让她们与她们对应颜色的配。<br />\n顶多会出现一对PpG×RrB，而我现在对要不要这么做持观望态度。<br />\n我个人对期待这些CP的粉丝们表示歉意。我个人的观点是，男孩们注意到自己是女孩们的不完美复制品这一点最终会导致角色们之间的关系下滑，即便是在他们 受到外界引诱的情况下。<br />\n请注意，我是在花花配上德克斯特之后才接手这个企划的：我无法改变这一点，但我也很有可能不会让它发展到底。但毕竟这是官配，这样的话，那我就得尽可能地让它发展下去。<br />\n恋爱是一个微妙的东西。只因为它能给特定人群一种模糊的感觉，并不能让我使它顺理成章地出现在我的故事设计中——要是它能同时将剧情以一种有趣的方式发展下去，这样的话，那我就会倾向于支持它。<br />\n提到这个，我就得说我实际上已经接受了花花×德克斯特，因为我一直在尝试发展他们俩的关系，以使它变得更加吸引人。你可以注意到，人们一直以来都在说，花花说话的方式越来越像德克斯特了。<br />\n看到了吗，如果你的伙伴不能影响到你，你是不可能产生一段关系的。这就是为什么在我们经历过这段关系最初形成的阶段之后，对于我来讲它（这段关系）是十分有趣的。<br />\n很多年轻人…在最初身在爱情的时候陷入其中；他们被一段关系最初的那段充满梦幻的时光深深吸引。这就是很多爱情电影和故事最主要的手法。但是，我则是对一段在每一天中维持下去的关系更感兴趣。<br />\n这种“他们会不会”的游戏已经让我厌烦了。:X 说真的，你们注重于让你们的爱情持续下去不是更好吗？<br />\n这是为什么我会对奥尔加成为争论点感兴趣的部分原因。花花和德克斯特建立起的关系能不能经历一场真正的考验？<br />\n以后，我会尽量参与到评论区的讨论中来。但是请注意，我一直在与疾病作斗争。我有一点点多病。比起保证漫画的持续更新，我并不能更多地保证能一直参与到评论中来。:B<br />\n不过我猜，下星期我们会有新的一张图。<br />\n再一次地，向所有花花×比比的粉丝致歉。但我觉得这件事情在萌芽阶段解决会更好，所以我就先说出来了。</p>\n\n<p>This is my first post with the new system.<br />\nI’m the writer for PpGD. Hello. Hola. 您好. Guten tag. Здравствуйте. こんにちは。 :0) honk honk<br />\nI am ill frequently, but I wanted to mention something here, as my medicine is working right now and I am fairly lucid.<br />\nLots of discussion on romance. Let me be clear about this:<br />\nI will not pair Blossom with Brick. Nor will I pair any of the girls with their color-match.<br />\nThere will be, at most, one PpG/RrB pairing, and I am currently on the fence about including it at all.<br />\nMy apologies to fans of these pairings. My personal opinion is that the awareness of the boys being imperfect copies of the girls will ultimately result in the characters’ attempts at a relationship falling through, even if they were goaded on by outside sources.<br />\nRemember, I came onto the project after Blossom had been matched with Dexter: I can’t change that, but I would have likely not done that either. Because it’s canon, though, I try to further it as best I can.<br />\nRomance is a delicate business. Just because it gives any particular group fuzzy feelings is not enough to justify it in the scheme of the story to me–if it simultaneously progresses the story in an interesting way, though, then I tend to support it.<br />\nIn that sense, I’ll say that I have actually come around to Blossom and Dexter, because their relationship is something I’ve try to expand on in order to make it more compelling. Notice how people keep mentioning how Blossom’s manner of speech is becoming more Dexter-like.<br />\nSee, you can’t have a relationship without your partner impacting you. That’s why a relationship is more interesting to me once we’re past the initial forming of it.<br />\nMost young people are… in love with the beginning of being in love; they obsess over the magical time that is the beginning of a relationship. That’s what a lot of romance movies and stories deal with primarily. I, however, am more interested in a relationship being sustained, day to day.<br />\nThe “will they won’t they” game gets me tired. :X In my humble opinion, it’s better to focus on keeping your love going.\nThat’s part of why Olga entering into the fray is interesting to me. Can the relationship Blossom and Dexter have formed survive a real test?<br />\nIn the future, I’ll try to participate in the comments a little bit. But remember, I’m fighting illness. I am some kind of sickie. I can’t promise consistency for comments anymore than I can promise consistency in comic updates. :B<br />\nBut we should have another page up next week, I think.<br />\nAgain, sorry to all you Blossom/Brick fans. But I think it’s kinder if I nip this one in the bud, so to speak.</p>","excerpt":"","languages":"zh-CN","categories":["chapter11"],"tags":[]},{"title":"重返舞台","permalink":"https://sckctranslate.github.io/ppgd/324/","link":"https://sckctranslate.github.io/ppgd/324/","date":"2015-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":null,"url":null,"email":null},"content":"<figure>\n  \n    <a href=\"/ppgd/325/\">\n      <picture>\n        <source srcset=\"https://sckctranslate.github.io/ppgd/assets/img/comic/chapter11/324-initial.webp\" type=\"image/webp\" />\n        <img src=\"https://sckctranslate.github.io/ppgd/assets/img/comic/chapter11/324-initial.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />\n      </picture>\n    </a>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<p>BeeAre：我想我们应该都知道是谁正在隆重回归到这个特别的百老汇舞台。飞天小女警这一主题，正是由她们的主要对手在幕后推动它发展的，而这正是众多细节中很有趣的一点。因为你看，他们是完全对立的。（这说法）很科学，对吧？</p>\n\n<p>BeeAre: I think we all know who’s making their big returning debut to this particular Broadway show.

A “Face” wrestler plays fairly and honorably, winning fans by being heroic when he fights. In contrast, a “Heel” wrestler plays the aggressive bad guy, who often fights dirty, and wins fans by his apparent disregard for rules in order to be the best fighter. A common move to shift the drama in the wrestling matches is to have a Face or a Heel wrestler “Turn” to the opposite of their previous style. It’s kinda like taking the gloves off when you’re boxing. Or… in this case, Bell’s hairband… and really, Blossom could USE some gloves right now.
