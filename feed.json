A “Face” wrestler plays fairly and honorably, winning fans by being heroic when he fights. In contrast, a “Heel” wrestler plays the aggressive bad guy, who often fights dirty, and wins fans by his apparent disregard for rules in order to be the best fighter. A common move to shift the drama in the wrestling matches is to have a Face or a Heel wrestler “Turn” to the opposite of their previous style. It’s kinda like taking the gloves off when you’re boxing. Or… in this case, Bell’s hairband… and really, Blossom could USE some gloves right now.
